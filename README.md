# Introduction

Repo for lab-projects and experiments in the subject IMT2291 - Web Technology at NTNU in Gj√∏vik.

# Running

* Each subfolder is a standalone web project. Some of them have dependencies listed in `composer.json`.
* Most of the projects require a web server (that handles PHP) to function properly. Place repo somewhere where your local web server can get to it (htdocs for. ex).
