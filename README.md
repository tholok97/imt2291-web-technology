# Introduction

Repo for lab-projects and experiments in the subject IMT2291 - Web Technology at NTNU in Gjøvik.

# Notes on running

* Each subfolder is a standalone web project. Some of them have dependencies listed in `composer.json`.
* Most of the projects require a web server (that handles PHP) to function properly. Place repo somewhere where your local web server can get to it (htdocs for. ex).
* Projects that use databases should have a .sql file with the exported database schema to be used for importing.

# Collaborators

* Yngve Hestem -> lab0123
